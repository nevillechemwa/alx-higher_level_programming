SQL - Introduction
SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language designed for managing and manipulating relational databases. It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to store, retrieve, update, and delete data efficiently. This README provides a brief introduction to SQL.

Features
Data Definition Language (DDL): SQL includes commands for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, and views. DDL statements allow users to define the structure and schema of a database.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): SQL offers a set of commands to insert, retrieve, update, and delete data in the database. DML statements enable users to perform operations on the data stored in tables.

Query Language: SQL provides a powerful querying capability, allowing users to retrieve specific data based on various conditions. SQL queries can join multiple tables, filter data, perform calculations, and sort the results.

Data Control Language (DCL): SQL includes commands to manage access rights and permissions on the database objects. DCL statements control user privileges, granting or revoking permissions to perform specific actions on the database.

Usage
To use SQL, you typically need a relational database management system (RDBMS) such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server. These RDBMSs provide an environment to create databases, execute SQL statements, and manage the data.

Installation: Install the preferred RDBMS software on your machine by following the vendor's instructions. Ensure that the RDBMS server is up and running.

Connect to the Database: Use appropriate credentials and connect to the desired database using a SQL client or command-line interface provided by the RDBMS.

Write and Execute SQL Statements: Start executing SQL statements to perform various operations on the database. This includes creating tables, inserting data, querying information, updating records, and more. Refer to the RDBMS documentation for specific syntax and usage examples.

Interact with the Results: SQL queries return result sets, which can be retrieved and processed in your application or SQL client. The results can be in tabular form, and you can manipulate, analyze, or display the data as needed.

Examples
Here are a few examples to illustrate SQL usage:

Creating a Table:

CREATE TABLE employees (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50),
  age INT,
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

Inserting Data:

INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age, salary)
VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 30, 5000.00);

Querying Data:

SELECT name, age, salary
FROM employees
WHERE age > 25;

Updating Data:

UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE age > 35;
These examples represent just a fraction of the SQL capabilities. SQL is a versatile language, allowing you to perform complex queries, aggregate data, manage relationships between tables, and more.
